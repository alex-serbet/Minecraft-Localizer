## About the Program
**Minecraft Localizer** is a tool for localizing Minecraft mods. The application allows you to automatically translate mods using [GPT4Free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free/), manage the translation process, save translations, and notify the user about the operation status through a convenient graphical interface.

## Features
- **Automatic Translation**: Supports automatic translation into any in-game language using [GPT4Free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free/) based on Deepseek **without using API keys or request limits**.

- **Multiple Modes Support**: Ability to choose different translation modes (*Mods, FTB Quests*).

- **Convenient Saving**: After translating mods, the program automatically saves all localization files into a resource pack in the game folder.

- **Interactive Interface**: Control the translation process through an easy-to-use interface.

- **Settings and Directories**: Easily manage settings and open required directories directly from the application.

- **Multilingual Support**: Ability to select the application's interface language (English, Russian, Ukrainian, Chinese).

## Usage
> [!IMPORTANT]
> [GPT4Free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free/) requires Python version 3.10+. If you don't have it, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. **Go to settings** and select your preferred language and game directory, then save the settings.
2. **Choose a translation mode** in the main window.
3. **Select the mod** you want to translate from the menu on the left and check it.
4. **Click the "Start Translation" button**. Install GPT4Free from the dialog window. After installation, also launch GPT4Free from the dialog window.
5. **Wait for the translation to complete**. If needed, you can cancel the process at any time and save already translated lines.
6. **Go to the "resourcepacks" folder** in the game directory and check if the "MinecraftLocalizer.zip" resource pack has been created. If not, click the "Save Translation" button.
